These friendly types are always willing to heal the sick or injured, support their allies in their darkest hours and show mercy upon the weak. In combat they attempt to divide and conquer the enemy rather than face it head-on. After the fray has ended; they are the first to mend the wounds of the fallen and bring life back to those who have passed to the other side of death.</description><proficiency>Healing and support</proficiency><strBonus>4</strBonus><perBonus>4</perBonus><intBonus>0</intBonus><dexBonus>0</dexBonus><chaBonus>6</chaBonus><vitBonus>6</vitBonus><magBonus>0</magBonus><staminaBonus>0</staminaBonus><attackBonus>0</attackBonus><reflexBonus>0</reflexBonus><feats>4</feats><movement>4</movement><skillPoints>+2</skillPoints><levelHealth>1d6+1</levelHealth></archtype></archtypes>
