		<description>Dedicating their lives to helping others, healers seek
to right the wrongs of the world, oppose evil and help
those in need. These friendly types are always willing
to heal the sick or injured, support their allies in their
darkest hours and show mercy upon the weak.
In combat they attempt to divide and conquer the enemy
rather than face it head-on. After the fray has
ended; they are the first to mend the wounds of the
fallen and bring life back to those who have passed to
the other side of death.</description>
